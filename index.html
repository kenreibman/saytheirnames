            <p class="showcase__p">As a white man I will never experience racism, but as a Jew,  I have experienced outright antisemitism and that, along with something else I dare not mention, is why I have great empathy for people of color. 
                And the fact that I was sucker punched, while installing the exhibit, and the person who did it did not suffer any consequences, shows that racism is still going strong. </p>
            <p class="showcase__p">Yes, this is not about me, but this is who I am. It was a privilege and an enriching experience to be able to devote myself to telling these stories and to try, in small part, to end the violence that is perpetrated against people of color and which is the tip of the cold hard iceberg that is systemic racism. </p>
            <p class="showcase__p">It is important to listen to these stories.  It is also important to teach the history of racism in the USA.  We cannot move forward if we do not understand the past. The list of names grows longer, So watch “Say Their Names” and then Say Their Names!</p>
